title: Python Operations and Operators
---
**Operators** are the constructs which can manipulate the value of operands.

Consider the expression `4 + 5 = 9`. Here, `4` and `5` are called _operands_ and `+` is called _operator_.

## Types of Operator

Python language supports the following types of operators.

*   Arithmetic Operators
*   Comparison (Relational) Operators
*   Assignment Operators
*   Logical Operators
*   Bitwise Operators
*   Membership Operators
*   Identity Operators

1.<b>Arithmetic operators</b> are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication etc.

<b>Example</b><br>
x = 15<br>
y = 4<br>

* Output: x + y = 19 <br>
A.Add two operands or unary plus<br>
print('x + y =',x+y)<br><br>

* Output: x - y = 11<br>
B.Subtract right operand from the left or unary minus<br>
print('x - y =',x-y)<br><br>

* Output: x * y = 60<br>
C.Multiply two operands<br>
print('x * y =',x*y)<br><br>

* Output: x / y = 3.75<br>
D.Divide left operand by the right one (always results into float)<br>
print('x / y =',x/y)<br><br>

* Output: x // y = 3<br>
E.Floor division - division that results into whole number adjusted to the left in the number line<br>
print('x // y =',x//y)<br><br>

* Output: x ** y = 50625<br>
F.Exponent - left operand raised to the power of right<br>
print('x ** y =',x**y)
